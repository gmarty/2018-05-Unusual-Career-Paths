Healthy (but not perfect) team

Notes:
Still have disagreement in the team.
* Diversity => open mind, empathy, different experiences and points of view.
Dyslexia can bring about people who can identify patterns and are focused on other peoples feelings and emotions.
* Inclusion => Safe environment, teammates can be themselves, healthy discussions.
Acceptance of lifestyle means some coworkers need to work from home.
Mutual respect
* Intersectionality => Relationship among team members.
Nobody felt heard so we worked on our differences using a framework.

Empathy

Notes:
* Empathy brings about a wealth of perspective that is needed when working on an app using by thousands of people daily.
* Pay attention to these 3 points when choosing a job.
